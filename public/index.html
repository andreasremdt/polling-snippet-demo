      Can diet and exercise lower your risk of dementia? Rigorous clinical
      trials aim to find out
    </h1>
    <p>
      For the past 3 years, about 6000 middle-aged and elderly Australians have
      pumped iron, loaded up on greens and whole grains, strived to quell
      stress, and challenged their wits with computer exercises, all in an
      effort to preserve their cognition. They’re part of a clinical trial
      called Maintain Your Brain, one of about 30 current or planned studies
      that eschew pharmaceutical interventions and test whether altering
      multiple aspects of participants’ lives improves brain health. Such
      multidomain studies may finally reveal whether modifying diet, exercise,
      and other factors can slow cognitive decline as people age—or even prevent
      dementia.

      “There’s a lot of hope for multidomain trials,” says psychologist Kaarin
      Anstey of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, one of the principal
      investigators of the Maintain Your Brain trial, which will finish by the
      end of this year.

      Although people can’t escape some mental decline as they get older,
      lifestyle exerts a powerful influence over the risk of developing
      dementia—the type of severe cognitive impairment seen in conditions such
      as Alzheimer’s disease. Last year, an international committee of
      scientists and psychiatrists known as the Lancet Commission on dementia
      prevention, intervention, and care estimated that so-called modifiable
      factors account for 40% of dementia risk. Their report highlighted a dozen
      factors, including many familiar villains—diabetes, high blood pressure,
      smoking, obesity, and lack of exercise.

      Researchers are still probing exactly how these risk factors steal
      people’s faculties, but they’ve identified some likely mechanisms. Lack of
      physical activity may impair cognition, for instance, because exercise
      stimulates formation of new neurons and soothes brain inflammation.

      For decades scientists concentrated on developing drugs to treat
      Alzheimer’s disease, but after several candidates recently failed in
      clinical trials, “the climate has really shifted to focus on …
      prevention,” says neuropsychiatrist and epidemiologist Kristine Yaffe of
      the University of California, San Francisco. Some researchers urge
      governments to step up dementia prevention with measures such as public
      health campaigns that encourage salutary habits. “We have knowledge about
      some of the actions to take for society to make a difference,” says
      psychiatrist Gill Livingston of University College London, who heads the
      Lancet Commission. “The time is now.”

    <p>
      The combined effect of lifestyle factors is strong, but researchers lack
      conclusive evidence that modifying any of them spares the brain. “A
      gazillion observational studies” point to factors that influence cognitive
      aging, Yaffe says. “Can we say, ‘Do X, Y, and Z and that will prevent
      Alzheimer’s disease’? I don’t think so.”

      Large, randomized, controlled trials would provide the strongest support
      for particular interventions. But these costly studies are rare. Multiyear
      trials, which have the best shot at detecting an impact on a
      slow-developing condition like dementia, are even rarer.
